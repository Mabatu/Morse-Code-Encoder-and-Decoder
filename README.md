#### Morse Code Encoder and Decoder

This repository contains a C++ program that encodes and decodes Morse code. The program allows users to input either a letter to be encoded into Morse code or Morse code to be decoded into a letter. It provides an interactive command-line interface for these operations.

####  Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

####  How to Use
Copy the raw code, paste in any text editor and save it with the '.cpp' extension.
Open the command prompt and run this command to compile the program:
```
g++ path\to\morse_code.cpp -o morse_code.exe
```
Once the program is compiled run the executable: 
```
morse.exe
```
You will be prompted to enter a letter or code. To exit the program just type `exit` and press enter.
That's all!
